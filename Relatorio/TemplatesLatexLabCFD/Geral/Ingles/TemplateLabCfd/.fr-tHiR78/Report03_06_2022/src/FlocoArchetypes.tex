\section{\Floco~Archetypes}
\subsection{General comments}
In this section, the current seven \Floco~SPM archetypes are presented. Moreover, two new archetypes and a new technology to be added as an booster in Archetype 1 are proposed based on \secref{sec:StateOfArt} review. At the end the section, possible future archetypes related to \CO-hydrocarbons membranes separation are discussed.

\Floco~SPM archetypes do not consider mass and molar fractions, just phases from wellhead or manifold stream, and seawater injection.

\tabref{tab:CurrentSpmArchetypes} presents subsea process associated to each Archetype.

\subsection{Archetype 1 - Multiphase boosting}
Archetype 1 does not have separation of wellhead or manifold stream, just boosting to host facility.

\end{figure}

All current booster technologies in \Floco~are pumps: traditional centrifugal; helicoaxial (HAP) and twin screw (TSP) multiphase~\citep{Hua2012, Solvik2013}; hybrid~\citep{Solvik2013}. As an alternative to boost untreated well or manifold stream from reservoirs with high gas content during their operational life, the wet gas compressor will be added as booster option to this archetype.

\subsection{Archetype 2 - Gas-Liquid separation + liquid boosting and gas compression to host facility}
Archetype 2 has two-phase separation of wellhead or manifold stream with liquid boosting and gas compression to host facility. \figref{fig:Archetype2} is a schematic representation of Archetype 2.

\end{figure}

Technologies in \Floco~to gas-liquid separation are: Caisson~\citep{Deuel2011}, vertical pipe (Saipem multipipe)~\citep{Vu2009, Jahnsen2011}, gas-liquid cylindrical cyclone (GLCC)~\citep{Ju2010} and vertical annular separation and pump system (VASPS)~\citep{Baker1991}.

\subsection{Archetype 3 - Gas-Water-Oil separation + liquid boosting and gas compression to host facility + water injection}
 Archetype 3 has a three-phase separation of wellhead or manifold stream with oil boosting and gas compression to host facility. Injection water pump to serial injection wells and manifolds of water stream. \figref{fig:Archetype3} is a schematic representation of Archetype 3.

Three-phase separation technologies in \Floco~are: gravitational vessel~\citep{Davies2010}, horizontal pipe~\citep{Sagatun2008} and spool~\citep{Shaiek2015}.

\subsection{Archetype 4 - Seawater injection}
Archetyoe 4 does not have separation of wellhead or manifold stream, just injection water pump to serial injection wells and mainfolds of seawater. \figref{fig:Archetype4} is a schematic representation of Archetype 4.

\subsection{Archetype 8 - \CO~dense phase separation + Oil/Water boosting to host facility + \CO~Injection}
The new Archetype 8 arises from \secref{sec:DensePhaseSeparation} review which shows \HiSep~separation principle and its applcability to SPS. The \CO~rich stream goes to centrifugal pumps to be injected whereas oily stream is boosted to host facility.

\subsection{Archetype 9 - \CO~dense phase separation + Oil/Water boosting to host facility + \CO~Injection + seawater injection}
The new Archetype 9 is a combination of the new Archetype 8 and the 4. The \CO~rich stream goes to centrifugal pumps to be injected whereas oily stream is boosted to host facility. It has also injection water pump to serial injection wells and mainfolds of seawater. Gas and water injection can coexist as the example in Harding field shown by \citet{James2012}. \figref{fig:Archetype9} is a schematic representation of Archetype 9.

\subsection{Possible future archetypes}
Possible future archetypes are related to the technology maturation of membranes to separate \CO-hydrocarbons. As discussed in \secref{sec:MembranesCo2Hydrocarbons}, the discussion is still in laboratory level, although oil companies have launched projects to find a proper membrane to be used in subsea conditions. These possible future archetypes would be membranes separation combined with Archetypes 1 to 3 and 5 to 7 to include membranes to separate \CO~from the main stream and inject it in the reservoir. Regarding to Archetypes 8 and 9, membranes process would be used to separate the remaining oil in \CO~rich stream and/or remove \CO~from oily stream. The former would generate a oil stream to be joined to the oily one from \HiSep~separation while the former would generate more \CO~to be injected with the \HiSep~\CO~rich stream.
