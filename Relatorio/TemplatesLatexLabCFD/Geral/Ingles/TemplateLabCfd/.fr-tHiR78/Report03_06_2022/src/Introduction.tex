\section{Introduction}
As oil and gas production have been done in more isolated areas and deeper water, floating production unit (FPU) and subsea umbilicals, risers and flowlines (SURF) demand more complexity in technical and economic perspectives~\citep{Basilio2018}. Moreover, the relief of offshore topside facilities is an objective of most operators due to the intrinsic risks associated with these harsh environments~\citep{Basilio2018}. In this context, subsea processing systems (SPS) arises as an option to perhaps allow the complete absence of FPU, and, combined with the usual subsea architectures, may enhance reservoir recovery, facilities reliability and availability, reduce topsides processing requirements and reduce the overall field development cost, therefore improving field economics~\citep{Basilio2018}.

As a consequence of SPS development, Deep Seed Solutions have added the main subsea technologies to \Floco at 2017~\citep{Oathkeeper2017}. In this first study~\citep{Oathkeeper2017}, seven subsea archetypes were considered important and are addressed in the subsea processing module (SPM). These archetypes consist in liquid boost, two-phase (gas + liquid) and three-phase (gas + oil + water) separation,  water and seawater injection , and gas compression to host facilities~\citep{Oathkeeper2017}.

In the present document, the SPS state of the art is presented, it is focused on the technologies which are not in \Floco yet. \Floco archetypes, old and the new one based on state of the art research, are also described with the technologies considered for each of them. A data flow diagram (DFD) is shown to clarify how SPM archetypes are included in \Floco.
